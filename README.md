# FlameHUD-ChrizEdit
My edit of FlameHUD

Drag "flame hud - chriz edit" into your custom folder to get the working hud.

2/17/17 - The only change I made was adding an outline to the crosshair wings to make them more visible.
If you would like to turn the outline off, go to resource/clientscheme.res and ctrl+f "konr" and turn outline 1 to outline 0.
If you would like to turn off all the crosshair shenanigans go into scripts/hudlayout.res and turn visible from 1 to 0 on everything from
"dark_top" through "crosshairspecialcombo 1"
